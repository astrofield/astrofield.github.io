You have to protect the transports from the field of asteroids with your X-Wing fighter.

1. You control the ship with the arrow keys.
2. Go right and left.
3. Use the spacebar to shoot missiles.
4. When you hit an asteroid with a missile, both blow up and you get **5** points.
5. When an asteroid escapes the screen, you lose **5** health.
6. When all health is lost, the game is over.
7. The ship, asteroids, and missiles all wrap around the screen.
8. The first level has 10 asteroids, the second 15, etc. and each level the game gets harder and faster.
